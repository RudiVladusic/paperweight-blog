# Paperweight-blog

I am building a small blog with CRUD operations and user authentication using react, react-router, redux, localstorage...

Front-end only.
Maybe at some point in future i will create a real database and back-end logic for this project.

## To do

- [x] Login form + logic
- [x] Register form + logic
- [x] General project structure
- [x] Routing
- [ ] Add icons
- [ ] UI design / implementation
- [ ] Organize css
- [ ] Regular maintenance and refactoring of the code
